Bridging the Gap Between Surplus Food and Hunger

Food waste is a major global issue, with millions of pounds of food being discarded daily while many individuals struggle with food insecurity. Restaurants, grocery stores, and food suppliers often have surplus food due to overproduction, unsold items, or expiration concerns. However, much of this food ends up in landfills because thereâ€™s no efficient way to connect it with those who need it.
FoodLink is a web-based application designed to solve this problem by directly connecting surplus food providers with individuals and organizations in need. Through a simple and intuitive interface, the platform allows:
Food providers to list their extra food in real time
Users (such as individuals, food banks, shelters) to browse and claim available food based on location, food type, and expiration date
Description of target browsers (iOS? Android? Which ones?)
FoodLink is designed to be fully responsive and accessible across a wide range of modern devices and browsers. It supports desktop browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge, ensuring consistent performance across platforms. On mobile, the application is compatible with Safari on iOS (version 13 and above) and Chrome on Android (version 8 and above). The front-end design uses contemporary CSS features like Flexbox and Grid to maintain a clean, user-friendly interface that adapts well to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience whether users are accessing the platform from a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer.
